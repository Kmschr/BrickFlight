# BrickFlight
Unity Brickadia Renderer/Game

## TODO/Project Ideas
### Performance
- Generate optimized meshes (no interior "non-manifold" faces)
- Store bricks in a more spatially aware datastructure? (how to octree?)
- Generate LOD meshes and enable LOD
- Make sure rendering pipeline is set up the best way for batched draws whatever that is

### Gameplay
- Make flying feel less janky
- Add more controls support for flying (keyboard yaw, joystick throttle/brake)
- Add a ground vehicle (semi truck would be cool)
- Be able to switch between plane controller and normal player controller
- More camera options
- Something to switch between shaders / change shader options

### UI
- Menu for loading saves
- Simple options menu
- Chat window for running commands
